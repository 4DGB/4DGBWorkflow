# Project Specification

⚠ This specification is a work in progress. Not all features specified here have been implemented yet and other features are subject to change.

## Input Parameters

The input to the workflow is a directory with a file named `workflow.yaml` or `project.yaml` with the following values:

```
project:
    name:       Project Name            (required)
    interval:   integer                 (optional, default=200000)
    annotation: file.gff3               (required)
    blackout:   [a list of bead IDs]    (optional)

sequence:
    name:       name of sequence        (required)
    data:       url of sequence         (required) 

tracks:
   - name: trackname_01
     file: input_01.csv
     columns: 
       - name: first
       - name: second
       - name: third
   - name: trackname_02
      file: input_01.csv
      columns:
        - name: first
        - name: second
        - name: fifth
          file: input_02.csv
    - ...

datasets:
    - name:     Name of first dataset   (optional)
      hic:      somefile.ext            (required)
    - name:     Name of second dataset  (optional)
      hic:      somefile.ext            (required)
```

## Computed Values

Quantities that are computed from input.

```
num_beads = (num base pairs in sequence)/(project:interval)
```

- **`beads`** a 1-based `integer` array of size `num_beads`, with IDs that go from 1 to (num_beads - 1) The first bead is at sequence position `interval`. Therefore, the first `[1, (interval - 1)]` beads are not represented in the 3D structure file.

## File Specifications

### Structure `.csv` file

A structure `.csv` file is a three-column csv file in which the first line names the coordinate `[x,y,z]` of the structure point. The ID of the point is the number of the line, where the first data line is ID `1`, and the ids increment by one until the last line. The file has `num_beads + 1` lines, the first of which is the name of the coordinate. There are three coordinates, and their order is not specified, but all three must be present. 

```
x,y,z
0.0,0.0,0.0
0.1,0.1,0.1
0.2,0.2,0.2
...
```

### Track data

A track is specified by a name, an input csv file and a list of column names in that file. The columns listed map directly onto the datasets in the `datasets` section. (So that first column belongs to the first dataset, the second to the second dataset and so on). Optionally, you can override the filename specified in each column so that a track can have data from seperate files.

Track data is parsed using the [csv2tracks](../scripts/csv2tracks) script. For more details, see its [documentation](readme_csv2tracks.md)

### Annotation `csv` file

A general file for providing annotations for the workflow's sequence.

```
name:   a string naming the annotation
start:  the 1-based ID of the start position in the sequence
end:    the 1-based ID of the end position in the sequence
id:     an identified for the annotation
type:   one of [gene, megadomain, or other user-defined type]
```

Example of the `annotation.csv` file:
```
name,start,end,id,type
first,100000,200000,CEN,megadomain
second,200000,300000,CEN,megadomain
```
