# Workflow settings
# You can specify the version of the
# workflow this project is for here
#
workflow:
  version: "1.4.0"

#
# Define main project settings here:
#
project:
  # Make a name for your project
  name: "example_project"
  # Select chromosome in Hi-C file to use
  chromosome: 'chr22'
  # Select bin resolution in Hi-C file to use
  resolution: 200000
  # Only contacts with a value higher than this in the Hi-C
  # file will be used
  count_threshold: 2.0
  # FENE bond coefficient used in LAMMPS simulation:
  # If LAMMPS fails with a "bad FENE bond" error,
  # try increasing this value
  bond_coeff: 55
  # Hide a sequence of bins in the browser view.
  # The structure made from the example data
  # has a long "tail" at the start that we black-out
  blackout:
    - [1, 85]

#
# Define Datasets here:
# Each dataset has a name and a path to a Hi-C file
#
datasets:
  - name: "0 Hours"

# Define data tracks here:
# The data for the second dataset is in a different file
# in this example, so you can see how the file is overriden
# for the second column in each dataset
